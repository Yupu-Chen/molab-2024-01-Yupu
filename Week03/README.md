## Yayoi Kusama Simulator

In my first SwiftUI APP, I experimented the Procedural Oriented Programming with a minimalistic artistic application. In this assignment, my goal is to produce generative art with randomness using an iOS app. My inspiration is a Japanese artist called Yayoi Kusama. She is famous for the use of Polka Dots in her work.

Yayoi's work of Polka Dots started with ordered and symmertry designs, but later became rather random.
