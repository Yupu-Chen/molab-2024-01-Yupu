## Yayoi Kusama Simulator

In my first SwiftUI APP, I experimented the Procedural Oriented Programming with a minimalistic artistic application. In this assignment, my goal is to produce generative art with randomness using an iOS app. My inspiration is a Japanese artist called Yayoi Kusama. She is famous for the use of Polka Dots in her work.

Yayoi's work of Polka Dots started with ordered and symmertry designs, but later became rather random (both styles can be seen in the following picture.

In my APP, I wanted to test what would happen if computers make arts following Yayoi's styles of random Polka dots.

Technically, I utilized many Swift features, such as optional types and extensions. I also started to get used to the ViewBuilder and View-based programming, which is a bit different from other OOP languages I have used before. Moreover, I also explored different builtin types and their applications. It was a tough learning process, but I am now more confident in programming with Swift.
