## Randome Barcode Generation

In this assignment, I explored UIKit, specifically UIImageRenderer and Core Graphics, by making an image that is based on random generation.

The code will generate a random number of lines based on random gaps and stroke weights. With different stroke weights, the colors of lines will be different. In doing so, I practiced some fundamentals of swift, including closures, functions, loops, and methods and properties in UIKit.

This is a good assignment for me to get more comfortable with Swift, and I am ready to explore more with SwiftUI.
